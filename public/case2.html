        <h2>John's Story</h2>
        <p><em>With my doctor's help, my dreams are back on track</em></p>
        <p>Maybe I should have been a little more careful, a little more aware of what was going on. But, to tell the truth, it all seemed so normal at the time. I was a high-performing, energetic sort of guy, and I just thought I'd pushed myself a little too hard.</p>
        <p>"I'll take some time off," I thought, "then I'll be fine".</p>
        <p>But that time off never happened. I just carried on as normal. Even when I dropped 10 pounds in less than two months, I explained it away as a normal side effect of a busy life.</p>
        <p>Of course, this couldn't continue. I found myself unable to explain what was happening to my body. Every step was like walking through molasses, and when I did manage to rest, I'd have to get up every ten minutes to pee.<br></p>
        <p>I spoke to my doctor, something I should have done much sooner, and he told me what was wrong. I had Type 1 Diabetes - a condition I'd never even thought about. I was much older than the average Type 1 patient and I'd never associated many of the symptoms I'd been experiencing with the condition.</p>
        <p>The lifestyle change of living with diabetes was enormous and it was difficult to adapt. I got on the insulin, and was disciplined about taking it. But I was still focused on my old life; on schoolwork, on classes, and on working out. I couldn't make time for all the sugar checks and everything else which comes with Type 1 Diabetes, and soon I found I was doing worse in my classes and in my exercise sessions. My sugar levels were all over the place. I'd take the same amount of insulin, and, instead of being ok, I'd be shaking and sweating with my sugar level at 20.</p>
        <p>The truth began to dawn on me: maybe I'd have to drop out of grad school.</p>
        <p>As my health deteriorated, my parents bought me a RiverRock membership. After only the first visit, I <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive: Understanding and education are critical for proper action. 'Doctor' is from the latin for 'teacher', after all...">understood more</span> about Type 1 Diabetes than I ever had before. Before coming to RiverRock, no one had ever even explained to me what the condition really was and how the medication actually helped. Now, the RiverRock team are helping me to understand my condition and the medication that will help me get to where I want to be.</p>
        <p>It is understanding the 'why' of the medication that has really set me on my track. I now approach it with more discipline, taking it regularly and feeling small improvements. I also understand why my sugar sometimes swung out of control due to snacks or to intense exercise.</p>
        <p>Recognising this helps me to monitor my sugar levels and to keep on top of my <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 2, Behavior and Habits: Once understanding is achieved, behavior can change">food and insulin intake</span>. Now, I have begun to get those swings under control.</p>
        <p>This means counting carbs every time I eat, which is a bit of a hassle. But <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Dream-Driven">I have a goal in mind</span>. I want to finish grad school. I want to keep my dreams on track. Keeping my sugar levels stable is the only way I can keep the focus and energy I need to achieve this.<br></p>
        <p>RiverRock also recommended an <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine">insulin pump</span> - something no one had ever mentioned to me before. My RiverRock doctor has taken the time to get to know me, to get to know my condition, and to get to know what I want out of life. He understands the dreams and goals that I have and he has prescribed the pump to help me achieve this. An insulin pump, I have learned, is a much easier and much more accurate way to get the insulin I need. This has changed everything, taking the hassle out of monitoring my food intake, while also providing me with the medication I need.<br></p>
        <p>While RiverRock is helping me to take care of myself in the right way and has got me back on track to finishing grad school and achieving the PhD I've always dreamed of, I know I am not out of the woods yet. My RiverRock doctor has educated me on the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine">risk of thyroid problems and celiac disease</span> in Type 1 Diabetics. With the team's help, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive">I now know which signs to look for</span> and I know to get tested regularly to stay fit, stay healthy, and stay on target.</p>
        <p>I know what I must do, and I know that my dreams are waiting for me around the corner. I <em>will</em>achieve my goal. I <em>will</em> manage my health. And I have RiverRock to thank for this.</p>
