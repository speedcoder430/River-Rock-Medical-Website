        <h2>Nick's Story</h2>
        <p><em>My Doctor is helping me take the vacation of a lifetime</em></p>
        <p>I was suffering from a swollen knee and had already visited my regular doctor for help. I had been through the x-ray and had a referral for an orthopedic surgeon in my hand, but I wanted a second opinion.</p>
        <p>Did I really need surgery? Iâ€™ll be honest, I was scared by the idea and I didn't really want to go that route if I could avoid it.</p>
        <p>When I turned to RiverRock Medical, I was initially surprised when they asked me <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Start with dreams">why I wanted my knee fixed</span>, but then I was intrigued when I finally understood what they were getting at. They wanted to know how to help me with my immediate problem and also make that work with my larger plans and life goals.</p>
        <p>I had a trip booked to Europe with my wife and I didn't want to be in a cast or on crutches. I wanted to walk everywhere with my wife and I wanted to enjoy the trip.</p>
        <p>Also, I wanted to retire from work on a high. I started the department that I managed; I literally pitched it to the CEO 30 years ago and I wanted to make sure it was in good hands before I rode off into the sunset.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>RiverRock Medical started with the diagnosis. They told me they thought it was a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine">meniscal tear</span> but they left no stone unturned and tested fluids to see if there was any infection. They pulled the fluid right there in the office, without a referral to a specialist. Then I got a MRI scan that confirmed their suspicions.</p>
        <p>The next part was absolutely amazing. I didn't have to go anywhere; My RiverRock doctor <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine: RiverRock partners with RubiconMD to allow rapid online consultations with top specialists">consulted online</span> with a top orthopedic surgeon and rheumatologist on my behalf. Both of them gave great advice and my doctor passed on all the useful information. Thanks to RiverRock Medical, I opted for physiotherapy, rather than surgery, just to see what we could do. I even rejected the steroid injections since my RiverRock Medical doctor thought I could do without, and, he was right.</p>
        <p>That was the interesting thing with RiverRock Medical. I felt I had the best doctor, who was making recommendations based on my actual circumstances rather than insurance company directives.</p>
        <p>The physical therapist, together with the specialists, explained that the meniscal tear was a result of overstressing the knee. So, we started work on <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 2, Behaviors">strengthening the knee</span> and the muscles around it.</p>
        <p>They went above and beyond to get to the root cause of the issue. There's no getting around the fact: I was overweight and that was putting a massive strain on all of my joints. It affected the way I walked and that compounded the problem, which probably caused the tear in the first place.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, I found myself discussing <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 2, Behaviors">dietary changes</span>, which I was suddenly more open to, as <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive">I understood the benefits</span>. I was under a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive/Emotional">stress at work</span> and I didn't think I could stick to a diet. Instead of giving up, RiverRock Medical's team then started to help me deal with the stress as a separate issue, which was fascinating. I mean, I came in for a consultation on my knee!</p>
        <p>The team actually helped me with lifestyle changes to reduce the stress. These changes allowed me to stick to a low carb diet, which then helped reduce the strain on my knee. We had gone from possible surgery to discussing <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Emotional">spending more time with my friends</span> and using the HeartMath mindfulness biofeedback device. To say it was a surprise would be an understatement.</p>
        <p>Since then, I have lost 20lb and look and feel better than ever. My stress is under control and we got to the underlying causes of the knee issue, rather than just patching up the damage.</p>
        <p>I was blown away by all of this. The depth of care was totally different than what I was used to. But, they went even further. The team <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine: Cholesterol Medication and aspirin are vastly overprescribed. The latest research states that only patients with a 10-year risk > 13.6% should receive a statin. For aspirin, it's > 30%.">calculated my 10-year cardiac risk</span> and determined that I didn't need cholesterol medication or aspirin, when my other doctor had already told me I would basically be on both of them for life.</p>
        <p>They gave me a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine">colon cancer screening</span>, with a new cologuard test rather than an invasive colonoscopy, and even offered me a supplement that could potentially stave off Parkinson's, which runs in my family. The NAC supplement they recommended is unproven, but it's safe and there's a chance it could help.</p>
        <p>The entire experience was so simple, transparent and thoughtful. The doctors all used the latest collaboration software so that I, and they, could see exactly where we were at any given time.</p>
        <p>The results, so far, have been amazing. I think I will enjoy my holiday with my wife. I am looking forward to walking everywhere and I am sure I can go back to work on my return. My reduced stress levels should help me sort out the issues at work. I'm looking forward to walking off into the sunset, rather than hobbling off on crutches.</p>
        <p>Thanks for your help!</p>

      <h1>Case 3: Nick's Story</h1>
      <p>
        I had a swollen knee and was told by another doctor it needed surgery, which scared me. But I had a trip to Europe with my wife and needed to find a fix. RiverRock diagnosed the problem, consulted with specialists and set me up with physiotherapy instead. The root cause was my weight overstressing the knee, so they helped me change my diet and deal with my work stress. I'm looking forward to walking off into the sunset, rather than hobbling off on crutches.<a id="openFull" href="#"> Read Nick's Story ...</a>
