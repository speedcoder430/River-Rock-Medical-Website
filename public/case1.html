        <h2>Malcolm's Story</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Malcolm, I work as CFO for a major hospital, a position I’ve held for the last fifteen years, putting in the hard yards non-stop, working solid 60 hour weeks, you know what it’s like — high workloads, high stress, huge responsibilities, striving hard to succeed and loving every minute of it. I’m lucky enough to have got to where I am today and to be completely financially secure, but the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 3, Holdovers and Scars: A history of overwork requires time and rest to heal. Although reducing or removing the stressors, category 2, habits and behaviors, is important, it's equally important to allow time to effect its cure">lifestyle does take its toll</span>, which is where RiverRock comes in. A good friend put me onto them and I haven’t looked back since.</p>
        <p>So, before RiverRock, I got to the point in my life where I was seriously considering starting a family with my girlfriend. Trouble is, I was concerned about having to slow down my work life if and when we married. I truly loved my job, and still do, despite the heavy workload or maybe because of it, if I’m being honest. And while it was exhausting me, I still did not want to give it up. <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Start with your dreams">My dream</span> was to have a family life and my work life, and the energy to commit and give my best to both. And that was <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Start analyzing obstacles">the problem</span>; my hard-working lifestyle drained me of energy to the point where I really felt I might have to choose one or the other, job or family.</p>
        <p>I’ve had trouble sleeping for many years, which I attributed to my heavy workload and high stress levels. So I self-medicated with sleeping pills but they only seemed to make things worse. I felt more and more tired during the day, and my sleep just didn’t give me any rest. I went through a few different doctors but they just prescribed the usual medications. I really feel that I was approaching a critical decision point in my life when my friend pointed me in the direction of RiverRock. Everything literally changed from then on. Their medical practice is more like having your own elite personal trainer except he’s your elite personal doctor instead of a sports scientist. Their approach is goal oriented, integrated and holistic, which immediately appealed to the corporate manager in me. They helped me transform the way I approach my work life and gave me back the energy I needed to succeed at work and at home, but it hasn’t been easy.</p>
        <p>First up, my doctor quickly <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4, Standard Medicine: Sleep Apnea is widely under-diagnosed">diagnosed that I had sleep apnea</span>. I know I’ve always been a snorer, or so I‘m told, but I was just not aware that it was waking me up all the time in the middle of the night. So we began my transformation with a CPAP machine that had immediate results. That and simple things like <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 2, Behaviors and Habits: Blue Light exposure decreases melatonin levels, sleep hygeine habits are critical for good sleep">limiting blue light exposure</span> at night from my laptop and phone, getting some sun, ditching the TV in my bedroom, and changing my eating times, real simple stuff but all combined together I started to finally get some decent unmedicated sleep, once I <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 4: Medication management of sleep is an inappropriate long-term strategy and increases the risk of death by 300%">ditched the Benadryl</span>.</p>
        <p>That was the easy part but unlike your usual GP, RiverRock didn’t stop there. They're all about getting to the root of the problem and not just treating the symptoms. So next came the real lifestyle changes to get my fitness levels up and drop some weight, which included <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 2, Behaviors and Habits: Exercise">starting aerobic and weight training with a low-carb diet</span> plus ‘work-life balance’ <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive/Emotional: counseling can both improve sleep as well as exercise efficacy, motivation, and long-term mental health">counseling sessions</span> to get some perspective and keep on top of it all. I’m still at it, with a ways to go yet but it’s amazing how much energy you can get back if you put the time and the effort in.</p>
        <p>RiverRock has been an eye-opener for me, nothing like just going to some pill pushing GP who can’t even remember your name. They helped me totally reconfigure my approach to work and wellbeing, and get my energy levels back up to where I remember they were when I was starting out in my job. And best of all, thanks to the docs at RiverRock, I'm feeling confident I can both excel at my job as well as finally <span class="tooltip" data-tip="Category 1, Cognitive/Emotional: Married men live longer, and truly intimate relationships are an excellent predictor of longevity across cultures">commit to my girlfriend</span> and start out together on the next big journey.</p>
